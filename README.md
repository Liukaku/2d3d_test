# 2d3d test game

this is a "test" project for experimenting with a 2d sprite in a 3d world game

TODO:
- within PlayerController.cs ChangeTarget() it should be updated to use a single target rather than pass one to every instance of the spell classes
- figure out what i'm actually doing with this, a story or what?
